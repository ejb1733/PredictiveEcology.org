My research interests lie in applied ecology, conservation and forecasting of a broad array of ecosystems and species. Specifically, I am interested in using modern quantitative techniques to understand the natural complexity of ecosystems, ultimately, to allow forecasting of organisms and ecosystem processes. I use a variety of quantitative techniques, including Hierarchical Bayes, Spatial Analysis, Landscape Simulation Modeling, Structural Equation Modeling, and Non-Linear Models to achieve the best ecological inference from ecological data. Through each of the systems I study, I strive to understand the ecological processes and to test this understanding by forecasting.
