::: {#ceres}
Research Scientist, Natural Resources Canada 

As part of the Predictive Ecology Lab, Ceres worked on mixed severity spatial fire modelling and the associated vegetation changes that go with it, as part of the [Landscapes in Motion project](https://www.landscapesinmotion.ca/). She then worked on on ecological forecasting of permafrost, disturbance, and vegetation in Northwest Territories, in a collaboration with the [Forest Ecology Lab](https://www.forestecology.ca/) at Wilfrid Laurier University, as part of the [Northern Water Futures](https://northernwaterfutures.wordpress.com/) project.

After spending some time as Climate Change Research Ecologist at the BC Ministry of Forests, Ceres took a Research Scientist position at the Pacific Forestry Centre, Canadian Forest Service where she continues to actively collaborate with the Predictive Ecology Community.
